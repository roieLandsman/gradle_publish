# gradle_publish
basic gradle publish examples in kotlin and groovy

for the scripts to work you musr have gradle.properties file in your gradleHome folder.
usually in USER_HOME/.gradle.

if your project works with git DO NOT put your gradle.properties file inside the project.
you will commit it with the credentials and thats not good.


grade.properties example:
artifactory_url=..............
artifactory_publish_url=......
artifactory_username=.........
artifactory_password=.........
